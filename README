Instructions:

1) Run a full Bitcoin node (find instructions elsewhere)

2) Run install/install.py to create a new sqllite3 database
   Can run install/uninstall.py to drop the database tables and allow rerunning install/install.py

3) Run install/add_price_data.py to import historical price data 
   daily_history.csv must exist in the root directory in the correct format

4) Run install/add_blocks.py to save block hashes for reorg detection
   This is optional as full_node_monitor.py will do the same thing during it's first run

5) Create config.json. Format:
   {
   "SERVER": <server>,
   "PORT": <port>,
   "BOT_EMAIL": <email>,
   "BOT_PASSWORD": <pass>,
   "HUMAN_EMAIL": <your email>
   }

6) Run full_node_monitor.py
   This is the main loop
   This will read and write the database tables created earlier
